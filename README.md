   git clone https://github.com/gianlucaminoprio/WalletKeyboard.git
   cd WalletKeyboard
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

   open Wallet_Keyboard.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run the project on your iOS device.

## Adding the Amanu Keyboard

After installing the app, you need to add the Amanu keyboard to your device:

1. Go to your iOS Settings
2. Navigate to General > Keyboard > Keyboards
3. Tap "Add New Keyboard"
4. Select "Amanu Wallet"
5. Enable "Allow Full Access" for the Amanu keyboard

## Using Amanu Wallet

1. Open any messaging app
2. Tap the text input field
3. Switch to the Amanu keyboard
4. Enter the amount you want to send
5. Tap "Send"
6. The keyboard will insert a payment link into your message

The recipient can then click the link to claim the funds, even if they don't have Amanu Wallet installed.

## Vision

We believe that every wallet should offer this functionality to their users. By allowing people to pay directly where they already are, without having to move to third-party apps, we can bootstrap the crypto economy and drive viral crypto adoption - every payment becomes a new user.
